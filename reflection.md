## 2. Task Allocation
The tasks for this project were allocated based on our individual strengths and interests. The following is a breakdown of the primary contributions:

| Task | Primary Contributor |
| :--- | :--- |
| Project Plan & Assumptions (`plan.md`) | Sathwik Bongoni |
| Network Design & Diagrams (`network.md`) | Mallala Sai Deekshith |
| Cloud Services Analysis (`cloud.md`) | Sathwik Bongoni |
| Security Risk Assessment (`security.md`) | Mallala Sai Deekshith |
| Ethical Issues Analysis (`ethics.md`) | Sathwik Bongoni |
| Project Reflection & Video Script (`reflection.md`) | Mallala Sai Deekshith |
| Final Review and Editing | Both Members |

## 3. Analysis of Commits and Contribution
The GitHub commit history provides a clear timeline of our work. Sathwik Bongoni made a higher number of commits, primarily focused on setting up the repository structure, writing the initial drafts of the plan, cloud, and ethics sections, and performing final edits. Mallala Sai Deekshith's commits, while slightly fewer, involved the time-intensive work of researching and creating the network diagrams in draw.io, configuring the detailed security risk assessment spreadsheet, and drafting the reflection. The number of commits is not directly proportional to the effort; the diagram and spreadsheet work required significant effort but resulted in fewer, larger commits, while writing tasks naturally involved more frequent, smaller commits.

## 4. Consistency of Contribution
Our group maintained a consistent workflow over the term. Commits were made during 5 out of the 6 weeks of the project period. This consistent pace was sufficient to ensure steady progress, meet all intermediate deadlines, and allow time for a thorough final review of all materials without last-minute stress.

## 5. Group Reflection
**What worked well:** Our clear initial division of tasks during the first week was the foundation of our success. Using WhatsApp for instant communication allowed us to quickly resolve questions and coordinate our work. Utilizing GitHub for all documentation ensured we always had a single, updated source of truth and avoided version control conflicts.

**Issues encountered:** Our main challenge was initially understanding the specific requirements for the cloud pricing calculators, which required some back-and-forth research. We also had to learn how to effectively use draw.io for professional network diagrams.

**Recommendations for future projects:**
-   **Technique 1: Mid-Week Check-Ins:** In addition to our main weekly meeting, a brief 5-minute check-in via WhatsApp message on another day would have helped us track progress on larger tasks like the network diagram and risk assessment, ensuring we were both on schedule.
-   **Technique 2: Peer Review Before Commits:** Implementing a quick rule where we would share a screenshot of a completed diagram or a draft of a section in WhatsApp before committing it to GitHub would have allowed for immediate feedback and improved the quality of our initial commits, reducing the need for minor fix-up commits later.
