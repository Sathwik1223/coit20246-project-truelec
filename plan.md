## Communication Plan
Our team will coordinate through a combination of in-person meetings and digital communication:
- **Weekly Meetings:** We will meet every Wednesday after class to sync up on progress and assign tasks for the week.
- **Online Updates:** We will use WhatsApp for quick daily updates and reminders.
- **Primary Tool:** All final work, including diagrams and documents, will be managed through this GitHub repository. Every team member is responsible for committing their own work regularly.

## Project Schedule
The project will be broken down into weekly goals to ensure steady progress.

| Week | Key Tasks and Goals |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Week 1** | Finalise project scope and assumptions. Create initial draft diagrams for the Melbourne HQ and the Brisbane branch network. |
| **Week 2** | Complete the network diagrams. Finalise the IP address plan. Research and select appropriate hardware (routers, switches, APs). |
| **Week 3** | Research cloud VMs. Get price estimates from Azure and AWS. Calculate and compare the 5-year costs of cloud vs. new servers. |
| **Week 4** | Perform the cybersecurity risk assessment. Identify main threats and recommend key security controls for the network. |
| **Week 5** | Compile the final report sections. Draft the ethical considerations. Prepare and record the project presentation video. |

## Project Assumptions
To provide a concrete design, we have based our plan on the following details:

1.  **Headquarters Location:** Melbourne, VIC.
2.  **Branch Office Locations:** The network will support branches in Brisbane, QLD; Perth, WA; and Adelaide, SA. The Brisbane branch will be the primary model for our detailed branch office design.
3.  **Staff Count:** The Melbourne headquarters will be designed for **68 staff**. The Brisbane branch office will be designed for **24 staff**.
